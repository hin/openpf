# OpenPF parser

This is a simple parser for OpenPF files that are used as input and output for different
antenna modelling software packages.

The OpenPF file format is described here:

## Current features

Currently the code just parses the fileformat and dumps a description of its contents

## Future plans

The plan is to be able to convert to different file formats relevant for antenna modelling
and RF propagation modelling packages.
